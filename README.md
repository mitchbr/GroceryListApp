# Grocery List

An app used for storing recipes and creating checklists for the grocery store

## Future Plans
Currently, I'm finishing up my recipe API, as well as making a PoC mobile app which utilizes its endpoints. The plan with this is to begin integrating the API endpoints into the grocery list app. I'm hoping to have a method to upload recipes, follow other users, and share recipes with each other. I have been creating a design which can be viewed on [Moqups](https://app.moqups.com/MltxY1FjFnH79G6LCsYqQ0UeCczZlPha/view/page/ad64222d5)
